# WorldSeed
To help grow new .NET web applications! Hehe.

# Main goal:
1# To create a secure, fast, loosely coupled framework that can be used as base for any project.

# Other goals: 
1# To have only one code base to maintain and everything else should be an extension. This way any improvements you make to the framework can be shared between projects, saving time and money.

# The framework:
As a developer I dislike reinventing the wheel every time I am assigned to work on a project, I wish to create a framework that can be used to quickly create projects, without having to sacrifice security or the quality of the code.

# Features:
- Clean architecture
- Repository pattern
- Unit Of work pattern
- Services pattern
- API based token Authentication
